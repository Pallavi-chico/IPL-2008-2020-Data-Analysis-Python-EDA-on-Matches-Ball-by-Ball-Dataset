# IPL Data Analysis (2008–2020) – EDA & Insights

## Project Overview

This project performs in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets spanning from 2008 to 2020. Using match-level and ball-by-ball level data, the study answers 35 business-relevant and performance-oriented questions about teams, players, matches, venues, and strategies. The analysis uncovers patterns and provides insights into winning factors, player contributions, toss advantages, venue impacts, and more.

## Datasets

- **IPL Matches 2008–2020:** Match-level summary including teams, results, venues, dates, toss decisions, etc.
- **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008–2020:** Detailed delivery-level data with batsman, bowler, runs, extras, and dismissal types.

## Objectives

The project focuses on answering 35 comprehensive questions including but not limited to:

- Which teams won the most matches?
- Which player won the most Player of the Match awards?
- What is the most successful venue?
- Which bowler has the most wickets?
- Who are the top run-scorers per season?
- What role does toss play in match outcomes?
- Team-wise performance trends across seasons
- Bowling economy, strike rate, and dot ball analysis

…and many more!
